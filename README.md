# Hey! ðŸ‘‹
I am a backend developer currently living in Jakarta, Indonesia.

I guess lately, being active in Python development, but I prefer to think of myself as a person who has much understanding of programming languages. I get bored quickly, so I make sure I keep learning new things all the time! I like to build impactful software and the idea of open source in general.


## ðŸ’» Languages I've coded in
Here's a list of all (I _think_) the languages I've written code in!

### Languages and frameworks I've worked with
- PHP (Native, CodeIgniter, Laravel)
- Python (Django, Flask)
- JavaScript for the backend (Express.js)
- Go (Gorilla, Gin)
